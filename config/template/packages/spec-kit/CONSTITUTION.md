# Fitted Constitutional Rules (v1)
- Safety & Privacy first: capture only with explicit consent; photos processed per user settings; minimize retention.
- Measurement provenance: all derived sizes annotate source (front/side timestamps, LiDAR present/absent).
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA; pointer target ≥44×44; VO/TalkBack scripted paths for capture screens.
- Truthful UX: timers (10s/5s/5s) exact; LiDAR status surfaced inline; error states explicit.
- No dark patterns: clear CTAs (“Get Started”, “Continue”, “Allow Camera Access”, “I’m Ready”, “Start Shopping”) and undo paths.
